This is a WIP project, where I try to improve on the original card database for the Trading Card Game Yu-Gi-Oh!

Therefore I would like to mention the following:
Konami for making the card game in the first place.
 db-ygoresources-com where each card is stored in a JSON file which made populating my database easier.

 Next steps:
 - front end side to look for cards
   - populate the filter with suitable criteria
 - update database entries to reflect actual data on the cards
